This Plugin lets you use SAPI5 as your primary text-to-speech system within MUSHclient.
It uses a command, tts, to set various options.

"TTs" by itself toggles whether or not text from the connected world is automatically read.
The "rate" command lets you adjust the speaking rate of the voice.
"tts rate": tells you the current rate.
"tts rate 10": sets the rate to 10.  The range is -10 (slowest) to 10 (fastest).
the "volume" command lets you adjust the volume of the voice.
"tts volume": tells you the current volume.
"tts volume 100": sets the volume to 100%.  The range is 0 (silent) to 100 (loudest).
The "voice" command lets you adjust the voice that is speaking, from the installed voices on your system.
"tts voice": tells you what voice is currently speaking.
"tts voice microsoft": sets the voice to the first microsoft voice on your system.  Note that the names of the voices to use are specific to your computer and are available to view in the control panel.  You need not provide the full name of the voice, "sam" will match "Microsoft Sam".
The "key" command lets you adjust the keyboard shortcut to stop speech.
"tts key": tells you the currently set key (esc is default)
"Tts key pause": sets the key to the pause key on your keyboard.  To find out the name of a specific key or key combination to use here, use the "key name" dialog box under the input menu.
the "help" command reads this information.

The options you choose for rate, volume, voice and key are stored in properties within the plugin and are specific to each world in which you use this plugin.  This means you can have different voices in different worlds.

The plugin has two aliases you can call in your triggers.  tts_interrupt [text] will stop what it's currently saying and speak the text you provide instead.  tts_stop will cause the voice to instantly stop.  By default this alias is bound to the escape key, although you can change this through the tts command.

The plugin currently reads inbound text from your connected world, and tab-completion.  It will work even if you are outside of the MUSHclient window.
